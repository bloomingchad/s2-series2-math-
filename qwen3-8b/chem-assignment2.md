### **Step 1: Choose a Molecule**  
I have selected **Ethane (C₂H₆)** as the molecule for this assignment. Ethane is a simple alkane with 
two carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, making it an ideal candidate for spectroscopic analysis due 
to its straightforward structure and minimal functional groups. Ethane is a hydrocarbon commonly 
found in natural gas and is a fundamental building block in organic chemistry. Its simplicity allows 
for clear interpretation of its infrared (IR) spectrum, which is essential for understanding the 
principles of spectroscopy.  

Ethane is a saturated hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only single bonds between carbon atoms. This 
lack of multiple bonds or heteroatoms (such as oxygen, nitrogen, or halogens) simplifies its IR 
spectrum, as there are fewer vibrational modes to analyze. The molecule's symmetry also plays a 
critical role in determining the intensity and position of peaks in the IR spectrum. By studying 
ethane, we can apply spectroscopic techniques to identify molecular structure, a key skill for 
characterizing engineering materials.

### **Step 2: IR Spectrum of Ethane**  
Using the **NIST Chemistry Webbook** (https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/), I searched for "ethane" 
and found its IR spectrum. The spectrum is available in the **FT-IR** format, with the "Display as" 
option set to **% Transmittance**. The IR spectrum of ethane is characterized by several key 
absorption bands that correspond to specific vibrational modes of the molecule.  

**Key Peaks in the IR Spectrum of Ethane**:  
1. **C-H Stretching (3000–3100 cm⁻¹)**:  
   - **Peak Position**: ~3050 cm⁻¹  
   - **Intensity**: Strong (high absorbance)  
   - **Explanation**: This peak corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibrations of the C-H bonds 
in the methyl groups (CH₃). Ethane has two CH₃ groups, and the symmetric stretching of these bonds 
results in a strong absorption band. The broadness of the band is due to the coupling of multiple C-H 
vibrations. This peak is a hallmark of alkanes and confirms the presence of C-H bonds.  

2. **C-C Stretching (1470 cm⁻¹)**:  
   - **Peak Position**: ~1470 cm⁻  
   - **Intensity**: Medium (moderate absorbance)  
   - **Explanation**: This peak arises from the symmetric stretching of the C-C single bond. The C-C 
bond is a single bond with low bond strength, so its stretching vibration appears in this region. The 
absence of a peak at ~1600 cm⁻¹ (typical for C=C double bonds) further confirms that ethane is a 
saturated hydrocarbon.  

3. **C-H Bending (1350–1450 cm⁻¹)**:  
   - **Peak Position**: ~1370 cm⁻¹  
   - **Intensity**: Medium (moderate absorbance)  
   - **Explanation**: This peak corresponds to the bending vibrations of the C-H bonds in the ethane 
molecule. Bending vibrations typically occur at lower frequencies than stretching vibrations. The 
peak at 1370 cm⁻¹ is a characteristic fingerprint region peak for alkanes, as it is unique to the 
specific molecular structure.  

4. **C-C Bending (1300–1400 cm⁻¹)**:  
   - **Peak Position**: ~1330 cm⁻¹  
   - **Intensity**: Weak (low absorbance)  
   - **Explanation**: This peak is attributed to the bending vibrations of the C-C bond. The weak 
intensity of this peak is due to the low dipole moment associated with the C-C bending motion. This 
peak is also part of the fingerprint region, providing additional structural information about the 
molecule.  

5. **Other Minor Peaks**:  
   - Peaks in the range of 800–1000 cm⁻¹ may correspond to other vibrational modes, such as torsional 
vibrations or out-of-plane bending. These peaks are typically weaker and less diagnostic for 
structural elucidation.

### **Step 3: Explanation of the Spectrum and Structural Elucidation**  

#### **1. C-H Stretching (3000–3100 cm⁻¹)**  
- **Functional Group**: Alkane C-H bonds.  
- **Explanation**: The absorption band at ~3050 cm⁻¹ is due to the symmetric stretching of the C-H 
bonds in the two CH₃ groups of ethane. In alkanes, the C-H stretching vibrations occur in this region 
because the bond strength of C-H is relatively low. The symmetric stretching mode is more intense 
than the antisymmetric stretching mode (which is often split into two peaks in alkanes with multiple 
CH₃ groups). However, in ethane, the symmetry of the molecule leads to a single, strong peak. This 
peak is a key diagnostic for identifying alkanes.  

#### **2. C-C Stretching (1470 cm⁻¹)**  
- **Functional Group**: Single C-C bond.  
- **Explanation**: The peak at ~1470 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the symmetric stretching of the C-C single 
bond. This vibration is less intense than C-H stretching because the C-C bond has a lower dipole 
moment compared to C-H bonds. The absence of a peak at ~1600 cm⁻¹ (typical for C=C double bonds) 
confirms that ethane is a saturated hydrocarbon. This peak is also unique to alkanes and helps 
distinguish them from unsaturated hydrocarbons.  

#### **3. C-H Bending (1350–1450 cm⁻¹)**  
- **Functional Group**: C-H bending vibrations.  
- **Explanation**: The peak at ~1370 cm⁻¹ is due to the bending vibrations of the C-H bonds. Bending 
vibrations involve the movement of atoms perpendicular to the bond axis, resulting in lower energy 
transitions compared to stretching vibrations. This peak is part of the "fingerprint region" of the 
IR spectrum, which is unique to each molecule and provides detailed structural information. The 
position and intensity of this peak can help differentiate between different alkanes.  

#### **4. C-C Bending (1300–1400 cm⁻¹)**  
- **Functional Group**: C-C bending vibrations.  
- **Explanation**: The weak peak at ~1330 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the bending vibrations of the C-C bond. 
The low intensity of this peak is due to the low dipole moment of the C-C bond. This peak is also 
part of the fingerprint region and contributes to the unique IR signature of ethane.  

#### **5. Absence of Other Peaks**  
- **Functional Group**: No heteroatoms or multiple bonds.  
- **Explanation**: The absence of peaks in regions typical for functional groups like O-H (3200–3600 
cm⁻¹), C=O (1600–1700 cm⁻¹), or C≡C (2100–2260 cm⁻¹) confirms that ethane is a simple alkane with no 
heteroatoms or multiple bonds. This absence of other peaks is a critical indicator of the molecule's 
structure.  

#### **Structural Elucidation from the Spectrum**  
- **Molecular Formula Confirmation**: The combination of C-H stretching and C-C stretching peaks, 
along with the absence of other functional groups, aligns with the molecular formula **C₂H₆**.  
- **Symmetry of the Molecule**: The symmetric nature of ethane (C₂H₆) leads to certain vibrational 
modes being more intense or absent. For example, the symmetric stretching of the C-H bonds produces a 
strong peak, while the antisymmetric stretching is split into two peaks in more complex alkanes. 
However, in ethane, the symmetry of the molecule results in a single, strong peak.  
- **Role of Symmetry in IR Spectroscopy**: Symmetry in molecules can lead to the absence of certain 
vibrational modes. For example, the symmetric stretching of the C-C bond in ethane produces a peak at 
~1470 cm⁻¹, while the antisymmetric stretching is not observed due to the molecule's symmetry. This 
principle is essential for understanding how molecular structure influences IR spectra.  

**Importance of Spectroscopy in Engineering Materials**:  
Spectroscopic techniques like IR spectroscopy are vital for characterizing engineering materials. By 
analyzing the vibrational modes of molecules, we can determine their chemical composition, functional 
groups, and structural properties. This information is critical for developing materials with 
specific properties, such as strength, thermal stability, and chemical resistance. The ability to 
interpret IR spectra, as demonstrated with ethane, is a foundational skill in engineering and 
materials science.

### **Conclusion**  
The IR spectrum of ethane provides a clear example of how spectroscopic techniques can be used to 
determine molecular structure. By analyzing the positions and intensities of key absorption bands, we 
can identify the presence of C-H and C-C bonds, confirm the absence of heteroatoms or multiple bonds, 
and understand the role of molecular symmetry in vibrational modes. This exercise highlights the 
importance of spectroscopy in engineering materials, where the ability to analyze and interpret 
molecular structures is essential for innovation and problem-solving.
