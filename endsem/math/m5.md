**Study Strategy for Module V (Z-Transforms):**

1.  **Master Basic Z-Transforms:**
    *   Memorize the Z-transforms of fundamental sequences: unit impulse $\delta[n]$, unit step $u[n]$, $a^n u[n]$, $n u[n]$, $\sin(\omega_0 n) u[n]$, $\cos(\omega_0 n) u[n]$.
    *   Understand the definition: $Z\{x[n]\} = X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]z^{-n}$. For causal sequences, the sum starts from $n=0$.

2.  **Properties of Z-Transforms:**
    *   **Linearity:** $Z\{ax[n] + by[n]\} = aX(z) + bY(z)$.
    *   **Time Shifting:** $Z\{x[n-k]\} = z^{-k}X(z)$ (for $k>0$, right shift) and $Z\{x[n+k]\} = z^k X(z) - z^k \sum_{m=0}^{k-1} x[m]z^{-m}$ (for $k>0$, left shift).
    *   **Multiplication by $a^n$ (Damping Rule):** $Z\{a^n x[n]\} = X(z/a)$. This is very important.
    *   **Multiplication by $n$:** $Z\{n x[n]\} = -z \frac{d}{dz} X(z)$.
    *   **Convolution:** $Z\{x[n] * y[n]\} = X(z)Y(z)$.

3.  **Inverse Z-Transforms:**
    *   **Partial Fraction Expansion:** This is the most common method. Decompose $X(z)/z$ into partial fractions, then multiply by $z$ and find the inverse transform of each term.
    *   **Power Series Expansion (Long Division):** Useful for finding the first few terms of the sequence.
    *   **Residue Method (if covered):** A more advanced method for complex poles.
    *   **Using Properties in Reverse:** Apply the shifting and damping rules in reverse.

4.  **Region of Convergence (ROC):**
    *   Understand what ROC is and how to determine it for different types of sequences (right-sided, left-sided, two-sided).
    *   For rational Z-transforms, the ROC is typically an annulus or the exterior/interior of a circle.

5.  **Solving Difference Equations (if covered in your syllabus, though not explicitly listed in the provided syllabus points for Module V):** This is the primary application of Z-transforms. If your instructor mentioned it, review how to:
    *   Take the Z-transform of the difference equation.
    *   Use the time-shifting property.
    *   Solve for $Y(z)$.
    *   Find the inverse Z-transform of $Y(z)$.

Module V is heavily focused on applying the definitions and properties to find transforms and inverse transforms. Partial fraction expansion for inverse Z-transforms is a critical skill here.
