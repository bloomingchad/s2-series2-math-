**Study Strategy for Module III (Fourier Series):**

1.  **Taylor/Maclaurin Series:**
    *   Understand the general formulas for Taylor and Maclaurin series.
    *   Practice expanding common functions like $e^x, \sin x, \cos x, \ln(1+x), \frac{1}{1-x}$ around $x=0$ (Maclaurin) or a general point $a$ (Taylor).
    *   Be able to find derivatives of functions and substitute them into the series formula.

2.  **Fourier Series (Full Range):**
    *   **Euler's Formulas:** Memorize the formulas for $a_0, a_n, b_n$ for a function $f(x)$ defined on $[-L, L]$ or $[-\pi, \pi]$.
    *   **Symmetry:** Understand how even and odd functions simplify the calculation of coefficients ($b_n=0$ for even, $a_0=a_n=0$ for odd). This is a huge time-saver.
    *   **Integration:** Be proficient in integrating products of trigonometric functions and polynomials (integration by parts).
    *   **Piecewise Functions:** Practice finding coefficients for functions defined piecewise.

3.  **Half-Range Series:**
    *   Understand the concept of extending a function as an even or odd function to get a cosine or sine series, respectively.
    *   Know the specific formulas for $a_0, a_n$ for half-range cosine series and $b_n$ for half-range sine series.
    *   Practice problems for both types.

4.  **Convergence and Parseval's Theorem:**
    *   While proofs are not required, understand the conditions for convergence (Dirichlet's conditions).
    *   Be able to use the convergence property to sum specific numerical series (like the $\frac{\pi^2}{8}$ example).
    *   Know Parseval's theorem and how to apply it (though it's less frequently asked for direct calculation in these papers compared to finding the series itself).
