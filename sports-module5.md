## Module V: Yoga & Lifestyle - Harmony of Mind, Body, and Spirit üßò‚ú®

Yoga is more than just physical postures; it's a holistic discipline aimed at creating harmony between the mind, body, and spirit. Originating from the Sanskrit root 'Yuj' (meaning to join, yoke, or unite), yoga seeks to integrate these aspects into a cohesive whole, promoting healthy living. Its central methods include physical postures (Asanas), breathing techniques (Pranayama), and meditation.

### 4. The Eight Limbs of Yoga (Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali) üåü

Patanjali's Yoga Sutras outline an eightfold path (Ashtanga) providing a guide for holistic living and union of body, mind, and spirit. These are intended to be practiced integratively:

1.  **Yamas (Universal Moral/Ethical Observances - The "Don'ts"):**
    *   *Ahimsa:* Non-violence, non-harming.
    *   *Satya:* Truthfulness, non-falsehood.
    *   *Asteya:* Non-stealing.
    *   *Brahmacharya:* Continence, marital fidelity, or sexual restraint; responsible use of energy.
    *   *Aparigraha:* Non-avarice, non-possessiveness, non-hoarding.

2.  **Niyamas (Personal/Self-Discipline Observances - The "Do's"):**
    *   *Shaucha:* Purity, clearness of mind, speech, and body.
    *   *Santosha:* Contentment, acceptance of others and one's circumstances, optimism.
    *   *Tapas:* Persistence, perseverance, austerity, asceticism, self-discipline (the fiery effort that burns away impurities).
    *   *Svadhyaya:* Study of Vedas/scriptures, study of self, self-reflection, introspection.
    *   *Ishvarapranidhana:* Contemplation of or surrender to Ishvara (God/Supreme Being, Brahman, True Self, Unchanging Reality).

3.  **Asana (Physical Posture):**
    *   Originally intended for seated meditation, now adapted to encompass all physical yoga practices. A posture held with steadiness, comfort, and relaxation, without motion.

4.  **Pranayama (Breath Control):**
    *   Control of prana (vital life force) through breath.

5.  **Pratyahara (Withdrawal of the Senses):**
    *   Retracting sensory experience from external objects; consciously closing mind processes to the sensory world to seek self-knowledge and inner freedom. Not about physically closing eyes, but turning awareness inward.

6.  **Dharana (Concentration):**
    *   Holding the mind onto a particular inner state, subject, or topic; one-pointedness of mind.

7.  **Dhyana (Meditation):**
    *   Contemplation, reflection; profound, abstract meditation. Reflecting on whatever Dharana has focused on. An unbroken flow of attention.

8.  **Samadhi (Liberation/Union):**
    *   "Putting together, joining, harmonious whole, trance." Oneness with the subject of meditation; the mind loses the sense of its own identity and is absorbed in the object of contemplation. Blissful union with the Divine or True Self.

### 5. Stress Management through Yoga üòå

*   **Definition of Stress:** A state of mental or physical tension and worry caused by problems in life, work, etc. It's the body's reaction to a challenge or demand. Short bursts can be positive (e.g., meeting a deadline), but chronic stress is detrimental.

*   **Stress Management Techniques (Yoga plays a role in many of these):**
    *   Exercise (Asanas)
    *   Meditation (Dhyana, Yoga Nidra)
    *   Deep Breathing (Pranayama)
    *   Relaxation (Savasana, Yoga Nidra)
    *   Other techniques: Getting a hobby, pets, reading, spas, spending time in nature, time management, music.
