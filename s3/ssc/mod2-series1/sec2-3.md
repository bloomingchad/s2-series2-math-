**Flow sensors** (or flow meters) are devices used to measure the rate at which a fluid (liquid or gas) moves through a system. The flow rate is typically measured as **volumetric flow rate** (e.g., liters per minute) or **mass flow rate** (e.g., kilograms per second).

### **A. Pressure Gradient Technique for Flow Measurement**

This is one of the most common and fundamental methods for measuring fluid flow. It works by relating the flow rate to a pressure drop created by an obstruction in the flow path.

#### **1. Core Principle (Bernoulli's Principle)**

The pressure gradient technique is based on **Bernoulli's principle**, which states that for a fluid in motion, an increase in velocity occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure.

*   **How it Works:**
    1.  An obstruction or a constriction (a narrowing) is deliberately placed in the pipe.
    2.  As the fluid flows through this narrower section, its velocity increases to maintain the same volume flow rate.
    3.  According to Bernoulli's principle, this increase in velocity causes a corresponding drop in pressure.
    4.  The **pressure difference (ΔP)**, or pressure gradient, between the normal (upstream) section of the pipe and the constricted (downstream) section is measured.
    5.  This pressure difference is directly related to the flow rate of the fluid. A higher flow rate results in a larger pressure drop.

#### **2. Types of Differential Pressure Flow Sensors**

Several devices utilize this principle, differing mainly in the shape and design of the obstruction.

| Type | Description & Mechanism | Diagram | Advantages / Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Venturi Meter** | A tube with a smooth, tapered constriction (the "throat") and a gradual expansion. The pressure difference is measured between the wide inlet and the narrow throat. | [Click for figure](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=Venturi+meter+diagram) | **Advantages:** Highly accurate, low permanent pressure loss (energy efficient). <br> **Disadvantages:** Expensive, large, and complex to install. |
| **Orifice Plate** | A simple, thin metal plate with a precise hole (orifice) in the center, clamped between two pipe flanges. It is the most common type of differential pressure sensor. | [Click for figure](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=orifice+plate+flow+meter+diagram) | **Advantages:** Simple, very cheap, easy to install. <br> **Disadvantages:** Less accurate, causes a significant permanent pressure loss (inefficient). |
| **Pitot Tube** | Measures fluid flow velocity at a single point. It consists of two tubes: one facing the flow to measure the total (stagnation) pressure, and one perpendicular to the flow to measure the static pressure. The difference between these two pressures gives the dynamic pressure, from which velocity is calculated. | [Click for figure](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=pitot+tube+diagram) | **Advantages:** Simple, low cost, very low pressure drop. <br> **Disadvantages:** Measures velocity at only one point (not average flow), can get clogged easily by debris. Commonly used for measuring airspeed in aircraft. |

### **B. Thermal Transport Technique for Flow Measurement**

This method, also known as **thermal mass flow sensing** or **hot-wire anemometry**, measures fluid flow by observing the effect of the flowing fluid on a heated element. It is most commonly used for measuring the flow of gases.

#### **1. Core Principle (Convective Heat Transfer)**

*   **How it Works:**
    1.  A sensor element (like a wire or a film) is heated to a temperature above that of the flowing fluid.
    2.  As the fluid flows past the heated sensor, it carries away heat through **convection**.
    3.  The **rate of heat loss** from the sensor is directly proportional to the mass flow rate of the fluid. A higher flow rate results in more heat being carried away.
    4.  By measuring this heat loss, the flow rate can be determined.

#### **2. Types of Thermal Flow Sensors**

There are two main ways to measure the heat loss:

| Type | Working Principle | Diagram | Advantages / Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constant Temperature Anemometer (CTA)** | The electronic control circuit maintains the heated sensor at a **constant temperature** (and thus constant resistance). As the fluid flow increases and tries to cool the sensor, the circuit supplies more **current** to the heater to keep its temperature constant. The amount of current required is a direct measure of the flow rate. | [Click for figure](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=constant+temperature+anemometer+circuit+diagram) | **Advantages:** Very fast response time, high accuracy. Ideal for measuring turbulent and rapidly changing flows. |
| **Constant Power / Current Anemometer (CPA/CCA)** | A **constant amount of power** or current is supplied to the heated sensor. As the fluid flow increases, it cools the sensor more effectively, causing the sensor's **temperature and resistance to change**. This change in temperature (or resistance) is then measured and related to the flow rate. | | **Advantages:** Simpler and cheaper circuitry than CTA. <br> **Disadvantages:** Slower response time because it has to wait for the sensor's temperature to stabilize. |

### **Relevant Questions from Question Bank**

**Q6. Describe the working of a thermal flow meter.**
*   A thermal flow meter works on the principle of convective heat transfer. It uses a heated sensor placed in the flow stream. The flowing fluid cools the sensor by carrying heat away. The rate of this heat loss is directly proportional to the mass flow rate. The meter measures this heat loss, either by calculating the electrical power needed to keep the sensor at a constant temperature (Constant Temperature Anemometer) or by measuring the change in the sensor's temperature when supplied with constant power (Constant Power Anemometer).

**Q7. Explain the working of a differential pressure flow meter.**
*   A differential pressure flow meter operates based on Bernoulli's principle. It introduces a constriction (like an orifice plate or a venturi tube) into a pipe, which forces the fluid to accelerate as it passes through. This increase in velocity causes a measurable drop in pressure. A differential pressure sensor measures the pressure difference (ΔP) between the upstream point and the point of constriction. This ΔP is then used to calculate the fluid's flow rate, as a higher flow rate creates a larger pressure drop.

**Q10. Explain the working of a target type flow sensor.**
*   A target type flow sensor consists of a solid plate or disc (the "target") placed in the middle of the fluid stream. The flowing fluid exerts a drag force on this target. This force causes the target, which is mounted on a lever arm, to deflect. The amount of deflection or the force required to resist it is measured (often by a strain gauge or a force sensor). This force is proportional to the square of the fluid velocity, allowing the flow rate to be calculated.
