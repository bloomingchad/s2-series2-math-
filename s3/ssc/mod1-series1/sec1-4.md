## **1.4 Errors in Measurement**

In the science of measurement, it is understood that no measurement is ever perfectly accurate. There will always be a difference between the **measured value** and the **true value** of a quantity. This difference is called an **error**. Understanding the types and sources of errors is crucial for evaluating the reliability of a measurement and for minimizing their impact.

### **1. Definition of Error**

**Error** is the deviation of the measured value from the true (or actual) value of the quantity being measured.

*   **Static Error (Absolute Error):** The absolute difference between the measured value (A<sub>m</sub>) and the true value (A<sub>t</sub>).
    *   **Formula:** **δA = A<sub>m</sub> - A<sub>t</sub>**
    *   The error can be positive or negative.

*   **Relative Error:** The ratio of the absolute error to the true value. It is often expressed as a fraction or a percentage.
    *   **Formula:** **ε<sub>r</sub> = δA / A<sub>t</sub> = (A<sub>m</sub> - A<sub>t</sub>) / A<sub>t</sub>**

*   **Percentage Error:** The relative error expressed as a percentage.
    *   **Formula:** **%ε<sub>r</sub> = (δA / A<sub>t</sub>) × 100%**

*   **Static Correction (δC):** The negative of the static error. It is the value that must be added to the measured value to get the true value.
    *   **Formula:** **δC = -δA = A<sub>t</sub> - A<sub>m</sub>**

### **2. Classification of Errors**

Errors in measurement can be broadly classified into three main categories based on their source and nature.

#### **a) Gross Errors (or Human Errors / Blunders)**

These errors are primarily caused by human mistakes, carelessness, or blunders during the measurement process. They are typically large, unpredictable, and can be avoided with care.

*   **Sources:**
    *   **Misreading the instrument:** Incorrectly reading the scale (e.g., reading 25V as 2.5V).
    *   **Incorrect recording:** Writing down the wrong value (e.g., writing 1.15A instead of 1.51A).
    *   **Improper use of instruments:** Using an instrument incorrectly or for a purpose it's not designed for.
    *   **Calculation mistakes:** Errors in arithmetic after the measurement has been taken.
*   **How to Minimize:**
    *   Taking great care while reading and recording data.
    *   Taking multiple readings (at least three) and averaging them. If one reading is drastically different from the others, it can be identified as a gross error and discarded.

#### **b) Systematic Errors**

These are errors that remain constant or change in a predictable way for repeated measurements of the same quantity. They consistently affect the measurement in the same direction (i.e., the reading is always higher or always lower than the true value).

*   **Sources:** Systematic errors can be further divided into three sub-categories:
    1.  **Instrumental Errors:** These are inherent in the measuring instrument itself.
        *   **Causes:** Imperfect design, friction in moving parts, faulty calibration, or inherent limitations of the instrument (e.g., loading effect).
        *   **Example:** A zero error, where a voltmeter shows a small reading even when not connected to a circuit. A worn-out spring in an analog meter.
        *   **Minimization:** Careful calibration, proper instrument selection, and applying correction factors.

    2.  **Environmental Errors:** These are caused by external conditions and the surroundings in which the measurement is being taken.
        *   **Causes:** Changes in temperature, pressure, humidity, or the presence of stray electric or magnetic fields.
        *   **Example:** The resistance of a coil changing due to a rise in room temperature, affecting the reading of an ammeter.
        *   **Minimization:** Controlling the environment (e.g., using a temperature-controlled lab), shielding the instrument from external fields, and applying correction factors.

    3.  **Observational Errors (or Parallax Error):** These errors are introduced by the observer.
        *   **Cause:** The most common is **parallax error**, which occurs when the observer's eye is not positioned directly in line with the pointer and the scale.
        *   **Example:** Reading a meter from an angle will result in a slightly different value than reading it from directly in front.
        *   **Minimization:** Using instruments with mirrored scales (to align the pointer with its reflection), digital displays, or ensuring the eye is always perpendicular to the scale.

#### **c) Random Errors (or Accidental Errors)**

These are errors that occur due to a variety of small, unpredictable, and uncontrollable fluctuations in the measurement process. They are random in nature and cannot be eliminated, but they can be analyzed statistically.

*   **Sources:** Unpredictable changes in environmental conditions, minor vibrations, or noise in electronic circuits.
*   **Nature:** For a series of repeated readings, these errors will cause the values to be distributed randomly around a central value. Some readings will be slightly high, and some will be slightly low.
*   **How to Minimize:** The effect of random errors can be reduced by taking a large number of readings and then calculating the statistical average (mean). The more readings you take, the closer the average will be to the true value.

### **Relevant Questions from Question Bank**

**Q11. Differentiate between absolute error and percentage error.**
*   **Absolute Error** is the direct difference between the measured value and the true value (e.g., 0.5 Volts). It has the same units as the quantity being measured.
*   **Percentage Error** is the absolute error expressed as a percentage of the true value (e.g., 2%). It is a dimensionless quantity that provides a better indication of the measurement's relative accuracy.

**Q12. What is a systematic error? Explain various types of systematic errors.**
*   A **systematic error** is an error that consistently affects measurements in a single direction, either making them consistently higher or consistently lower than the true value.
*   The three main types are:
    1.  **Instrumental Errors:** Caused by faults within the instrument itself (e.g., incorrect calibration, zero error).
    2.  **Environmental Errors:** Caused by external conditions like temperature, pressure, or stray magnetic fields.
    3.  **Observational Errors:** Caused by the observer, most commonly parallax error.

**Q13. Differentiate between gross error and observational error.**
*   **Gross Error** is a blunder or mistake made by the person conducting the experiment, such as misreading the scale or recording the wrong number. It is usually large and can be avoided with care.
*   **Observational Error** is a type of systematic error caused by the technique of observation, such as parallax error when reading an analog meter. It is typically smaller and more consistent than a gross error.
