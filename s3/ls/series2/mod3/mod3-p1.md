### 1. Group and Team Dynamics

#### a. Definition of a Group

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "A group is a collection of individuals connected by and within a social relationship."
*   "A group is comprised of two or more individuals that share common interests or characteristics, but need not have a common goal."
*   "The members of the group interact with one another and also with the group as a whole. There will be a purpose of existence of every group."
*   "When individuals have common goals, common sentiments and greater interactions, they tend to develop attitudes towards each other and consequently they form groups."

##### **Explanation:**
A group is the most fundamental way people come together. Think of it as a collection of individuals who are linked by something—a shared interest (like a movie club), a common characteristic (like being engineering students), or a shared situation (like waiting for the same train). They interact, but they don't necessarily depend on each other to achieve a single, collective goal. Their individual purposes can still be more important than the group's purpose. It's the starting point from which more complex structures, like teams, can be formed.

#### b. Characteristics of a Group

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   **Frequent Interaction:** Includes interpersonal communication and relationship interaction.
*   **Interdependence:** Members have mutual influence on one another's outcomes.
*   **Hierarchy/Structure:** Leadership and a pattern of rules and norms, whether formal or informal.
*   **Common Objectives:** Common beliefs and common expectations regarding outcomes.
*   **Cohesiveness:** A sense of unity and togetherness among members; the "we-feeling".

##### **Explanation:**
These five pillars define what a group is. For an exam, if asked to describe a group, explaining these characteristics is key.
*   **Interaction:** People in a group don't just stand next to each other; they communicate. This is the basic activity of a group.
*   **Interdependence:** This means mExcellent. All mnemonics are now locked in. I will integrate them into the notes.

As requested, I will ensure the notes are comprehensive by synthesizing information from all the provided documents. I will also include links to Google Images for visual aids and provide practical explanations to help with apply-level questions.

Here is **Module 3: Group Dynamics and Leadership - Part 1/4**.

---embers are connected. What one person does can affect the others. *Apply-Level Example:* In a project group, if one member fails to do their research, the entire group's presentation is weakened. They are dependent on each other for success.
*   **Structure:** Every group has rules, even if they're not written down. There's often a natural leader, certain roles people fall into (the note-taker, the idea person, the critic), and an accepted way of behaving.
*   **Common Goals:** The group exists for a reason. It could be a formal goal (like completing a project) or an informal one (like providing social support for its members).
*   **Cohesiveness:** This is the emotional glue of the group. It's the force that makes members want to stay in the group. Groups with high cohesion are more united and effective.

#### c. Group vs. Team: Key Differences

This is a very common "apply-level" question. The syllabus and exam papers highlight this distinction. A team is a special, highly evolved type of group.

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   **Goal:** A group's focus can be on achieving individual goals. A team's focus is on achieving the team's collective goals. **A team has a common goal.**
*   **Responsibility/Accountability:** Group members do not share responsibility; they are individually accountable. **Team members share responsibility and are mutually accountable.**
*   **Contribution:** Groups produce individual work products. Teams produce collective work products through joint effort and synergy.
*   **Process:** A group discusses, decides, and then delegates tasks to individuals. A team discusses, decides, and does the work together.
*   **Synergy:** A group's performance is the sum of its individual members' contributions. A team creates **synergy**, where the collective output is greater than the sum of the individual parts (1+1=3).
*   **Skills:** Group skills are random and varied. Team skills are complementary and specifically chosen to fit together.

##### **Explanation:**
Imagine you are asked to "Differentiate between a group and a team with a suitable example."

*   **Example of a Group:** A group of students in the library all studying for the same Life Skills exam. They share a common interest (passing the exam) and are in the same location, but they are working individually. Their success is their own. Their output is individual (each person's own exam score).
*   **Example of a Team:** A group of students working together on a single lab report for that same Life Skills course. They have a single, **shared goal** (submit one high-quality report). They are **mutually accountable**—if the report is bad, everyone gets a bad grade. They produce a **collective work product** (the single report). They must work **interdependently**, combining their skills to write, edit, and format the final document. The result is a product of their combined effort, or synergy.

### 2. Group Formation: Tuckman's Stages

A very important theory for understanding how a group evolves into an effective team. The syllabus, slides, and exam papers all reference this model.

(Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, Adjourning)

[Click here to see a diagram of Tuckman's Stages](https://www.google.com/search?q=tuckman%27s+stages+of+group+development+diagram&tbm=isch)

#### a. Forming

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Team acquaints and establishes ground rules. Formalities are preserved and members are treated as strangers."
*   "This is the first stage in which entry of the new members and orientations to them happen. The members get to know each other."
*   "There will be some confusion among the members about the purpose and objective of the group."
*   "Members start to communicate their feelings but still view themselves as individuals rather than part of the team." (from Storming description, but indicates initial state)

##### **Explanation:**
This is the "orientation" or "polite" stage. The group has just been formed, and everyone is cautious and on their best behavior.
*   **Feelings:** Members feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. They are uncertain about their roles and how they will fit in.
*   **Behavior:** Communication is formal and polite. People avoid conflict and try to be agreeable. They are focused on understanding the task, the rules, and each other.
*   **Key Task:** The primary goal is to define the group's purpose, structure, and leadership. Members are dependent on a leader or facilitator to guide them.
*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** Imagine you are assigned a project group with three other students you don't know. The first meeting is the **Forming** stage. You'll likely spend time introducing yourselves, being polite, trying to understand the project requirements, and figuring out who might take the lead. There's a lot of uncertainty and very little conflict.
