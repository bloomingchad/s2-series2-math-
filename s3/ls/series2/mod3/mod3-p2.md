### 2. Group Formation: Tuckman's Stages (Continued)

#### b. Storming

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Members start to communicate their feelings but still view themselves as individuals... They resist control by group leaders and show hostility." (HUN 101 Slides, Diagram)
*   "This stage is characterised by the inevitable conflicts [that] arise in the group. Disagreements on roles, goals and procedures often lead to dissatisfaction." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   "The group members identify that the task at hand are more complicated than expected. The groups will be divided into subgroups."

##### **Explanation:**
This is the **conflict stage**. The politeness of the Forming stage is gone. Now, members start to push boundaries, and different personalities and work styles clash. This stage is critical for the group's growth; if it can't navigate this phase, it will likely fail.
*   **Feelings:** Frustration, annoyance, and anxiety are common. Members may feel their ideas are not being heard or may question the group's leadership and goals.
*   **Behavior:** Arguments, disagreements, and power struggles are the hallmarks of this stage. Members compete for status and roles. Cliques or subgroups might form, leading to a "we vs. they" mentality. Communication becomes more direct and sometimes aggressive.
*   **Key Task:** The challenge is to resolve conflicts and build trust without breaking the group apart. The group needs to learn how to disagree constructively and clarify roles and responsibilities.
*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** In your project group, after the first polite meeting, the **Storming** phase begins. One member wants to start coding immediately, while another insists on creating a detailed plan first. A third member is quiet and feels ignored. Arguments erupt over who should be the leader and which approach is best. This conflict is a natural and necessary part of figuring out how to work together. Successfully managing this stage is crucial.

#### c. Norming

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "People feel part of the team and realize that they can achieve work if they accept other viewpoints." (HUN 101 Slides, Diagram)
*   "The members will reach the expectation level of others and recognize the individual differences. The group begins to organize itself, resolve problems, sharing responsibilities and arriving at consensus." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   "Group members will develop mutual trust and a sense of identity. At the end of this stage, a group structure and a hierarchy will be emerged. Group will become focused on the mission."

##### **Explanation:**
This is the **resolution and organization stage**. Having survived the "storm," the group starts to come together. Members begin to appreciate each other's strengths and develop a shared sense of identity.
*   **Feelings:** A sense of relief, belonging, and growing trust. Members feel more comfortable sharing their opinions and receiving constructive feedback.
*   **Behavior:** The group establishes its "norms"—the unwritten rules of behavior. They agree on procedures, roles become clearer, and there is a spirit of cooperation. The focus shifts from individual conflicts to the collective goal. The group's identity ("we") becomes stronger.
*   **Key Task:** To solidify the group's processes and norms. The group develops its own way of operating, communicating, and making decisions. Leadership becomes more shared, and the facilitator steps back.
*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** Your project group resolves its conflicts. The members agree on a compromise: they will create a basic plan first, then start coding, and refine the plan as they go. They decide who is best at research, who is best at coding, and who will do the final presentation. They start using a shared Google Doc to track progress. They have found their rhythm and are beginning to work as a cohesive unit. This is the **Norming** stage.

#### d. Performing

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "The team works in an open and trusting atmosphere where flexibility is the key and hierarchy is of little importance." (HUN 101 Slides, Diagram)
*   "The group becomes fully functional and matured. The focus in this stage will be on solving any issue through collective work and sharing responsibilities." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   "The entire team work is used to accomplish the goal. Peak performance usually occurs towards the end of the stage."

##### **Explanation:**
This is the **high-performance stage**. The group is now a true team. The structure and processes are in place, allowing the team to focus all its energy on achieving its goals.
*   **Feelings:** Confidence, pride, and a strong sense of group identity. Members are highly motivated and invested in the team's success.
*   **Behavior:** The team is highly productive and efficient. Members work interdependently, often taking on different roles as needed without explicit direction. Disagreements still happen, but they are resolved quickly and constructively without disrupting progress. The hierarchy is less important because everyone is focused on the task.
*   **Key Task:** To achieve the group's goals with maximum effectiveness. The team operates with a high degree of autonomy and can handle complex problems without needing external supervision.
*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** Your project group is now in the final week before the deadline. Everyone knows their job. The coder is building the software, the researcher is providing the necessary data, and the presenter is creating the slides. They communicate seamlessly, helping each other out when someone gets stuck. They are making rapid progress and are on track to deliver a great project. This is the **Performing** stage.

#### e. Adjourning

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "The team conducts an assessment of the year and implements a plan for transitioning roles and recognizing members' contributions." (HUN 101 Slides, Diagram)
*   "Once the common objectives are accomplished, the group often adjourns or ends. Some groups may continue inactively, others may have a planned ending while some other groups naturally end." (HUN 101 Slides)

##### **Explanation:**
This is the **completion and dissolution stage**. This stage applies to temporary groups, like project teams or committees, that have a defined end point.
*   **Feelings:** A mix of emotions—sadness at the group's ending, pride in what has been accomplished, and perhaps some anxiety about the future.
*   **Behavior:** The team's focus shifts from the task to wrapping up. This includes documenting the work, celebrating the achievements, and providing feedback to each other. It's about finding closure.
*   **Key Task:** To end the project or task on a positive note, recognize contributions, and help members transition to their next roles.
*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** After submitting the project and giving the final presentation, your group meets one last time. You discuss what went well and what could have been better. You thank each other for the hard work and celebrate the good grade you received. The group then disbands as the project is over. This is the **Adjourning** stage.
