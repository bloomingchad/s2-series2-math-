### 1. The Foundational Triad (Morals, Ethics, Values)

This is a fundamental distinction and a very common exam question. Understanding the difference is crucial for answering apply-level questions correctly.

#### a. Morality

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Morality concerns principles of right and wrong in human behaviour mostly based on one's conscience and guided by values rather than legalities or custom." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Morals are the welfare principles enunciated by the wise people, based on their experience and wisdom." (Naagarazan Textbook)
*   "Morality is concerned with principles and practices of morals such as: (a) What ought or ought not to be done in a given situation? (b) What is right or wrong about the handling of a situation?" (Naagarazan Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Think of **morality** as your personal, internal compass. It's an individual's own sense of what is right and wrong, shaped by their upbringing, experiences, and personal beliefs. It's often prescriptive, meaning it tells you what you *should* do. For example, your personal morality might tell you that it's always wrong to lie, regardless of the situation.

*   **Moral Absolutism vs. Moral Relativism:**
    *   **Moral Absolutism:** The belief that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, universally, for everyone, in every situation (e.g., "Stealing is always wrong").
    *   **Moral Relativism:** The belief that what is right or wrong depends on the culture, society, or individual. It allows for different moral rules in different contexts (e.g., "What is considered polite in one culture might be rude in another").

#### b. Ethics

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Ethics is the set of codes or moral principles with which behaviour and beliefs are evaluated as right or wrong." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Ethics provides well-defined standards that tell people how to act and respond in situations in which they find themselves in." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Ethics is the word that refers to morals, values, and beliefs of the individuals, family or the society... Basically it is an activity and process of inquiry." (Naagarazan Textbook)
*   "Ethics is based on reason and logic. Ethics is not intuitive feelings or conscience." (Life Skills Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
If morality is your internal compass, **ethics** are the external, shared rules or code of conduct provided by a group, society, or profession. Ethics are systematic and logical. They are the standards you are expected to follow as a member of a particular group. For example, while your personal morality might be against lying, "Engineering Ethics" provides specific rules about when and why you must be truthful in professional reports.

#### c. Morality vs. Ethics: Key Differences

[Click here to see a diagram comparing Morality vs. Ethics](https://www.google.com/search?q=morality+vs+ethics+venn+diagram&tbm=isch)

| Feature | Morality | Ethics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source** | Individual conscience, personal beliefs, traditions. | Social system, professional group, external code. |
| **Nature** | Internal, subjective, and personal. | External, objective, and systematic. |
| **Scope** | More general and prescriptive ("You should not lie"). | More specific and descriptive/analytical ("Why is honesty required in professional conduct?"). |
| **Focus** | Concerned with the results of a **wrong** action. | Concerned with the results of a **right** action (and the principles behind it). |
| **Example** | "I believe it is wrong to harm animals." | "The Code of Ethics for veterinarians requires them to prioritize the animal's welfare." |

> **`Exam Tip:`** A common question is "Distinguish between morality and ethics." Use a table like the one above. A great way to summarize the difference for an apply-level answer is: **Morality governs the private person, while ethics governs the professional person.** Morality is what you believe is right; ethics is what a group or profession agrees is right.

### 2. Values

#### a. Definition and Types

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "A value is an enduring belief that influences our choices in life to promote well-being." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Values are principles that reflect one's judgment of what is important in life." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "A value is defined as a principle that promotes well-being or prevents harm... Values are our guidelines for our successâ€”our paradigm about what is acceptable." (Naagarazan Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Values are the fundamental beliefs that guide our actions and judgments. They are the "why" behind our morals and ethics. If you value "honesty," your moral compass will tell you not to lie, and you will follow the ethical code that requires truthfulness.
*   **General Values:** Some values are about preference or efficiency (e.g., competence, innovation, punctuality).
*   **Ethical Values:** These are values that are directly concerned with what is morally right and wrong (e.g., honesty, integrity, service, caring, sharing, empathy). All ethical values are values, but not all values are ethical values.

#### b. The Five Core Human Values

The Naagarazan textbook identifies five core human values as a foundational framework.

**Mnemonic:** **`T`all `R`ed `P`lants `L`ove `N`utrients**

1.  **Truth:** This value encompasses accuracy, honesty, fairness, integrity (unity of thought, word, and deed), and the quest for knowledge.
2.  **Right Conduct:** This refers to correct and ethical behavior. It is broken down into:
    *   *Self-Help Skills:* Hygiene, self-reliance, tidy appearance.
    *   *Social Skills:* Good manners, helpfulness, good relationships.
    *   *Ethical Skills:* Code of conduct, courage, dependability, responsibility.
3.  **Peace:** This value includes calmness, concentration, contentment, self-confidence, self-control, and satisfaction.
4.  **Love:** This encompasses acceptance, affection, care, compassion, empathy, friendship, generosity, and service.
5.  **Non-violence:** This includes both:
    *   *Psychological:* Benevolence, compassion, concern for others.
    *   *Social:* Appreciation of other cultures, care for the environment, and social justice.
