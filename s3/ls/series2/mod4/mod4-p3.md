#### e. Civic Virtue

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Civic virtues are moral duties or standards of righteous behavior of an individual as a responsible member of the community and an integral part of the environment." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Civic virtues are the moral duties and rights, as a citizen of the village or the country or an integral part of the society and environment." (Naagarazan Textbook)
*   "They are habits of citizens that contribute to the welfare of society." (Life Skills Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Civic virtue is the set of habits and responsibilities that a person upholds as a good citizen. It's about recognizing that you are part of a larger community and acting in a way that contributes to its well-being. It goes beyond just obeying the law; it involves active participation and a sense of duty towards society.

*   **Examples of Civic Duties (Responsibilities):**
    *   Paying taxes on time.
    *   Keeping surroundings and public places clean.
    *   Following road safety rules.
    *   Protecting the environment (not polluting).
*   **Examples of Civic Rights (Participation):**
    *   Voting in elections.
    *   Volunteering for community initiatives.
    *   Standing up against injustice in the community.

> **`Exam Tip:`** A question like "Describe civic virtue and how it is related to respect for others" would require you to connect these two concepts. You would explain that civic virtue is the *action* of being a good citizen, and this action is rooted in a fundamental *attitude* of respect for the rights, safety, and well-being of others in the community.

#### f. Respect for Others

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Respect is deference and acknowledgement of the importance of another person, his view points and his rights." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Respect for persons... means showing concern for the well-being of others, besides oneself." (Naagarazan Textbook)
*   "Recognize and accept the existence of other persons as human beings, because they have a right to live, just as you have." (Naagarazan Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Respect is the foundational attitude for all positive human interactions. It means recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of every individual. In a professional setting, this involves:
1.  **Listening to Others:** Hearing out their ideas and opinions, even if you disagree. The quote from Evelyn Hall is a perfect illustration: *"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."*
2.  **Valuing Diversity:** Respecting people from different backgrounds, cultures, races, and religions.
3.  **Constructive Criticism:** Appreciating the positive contributions of colleagues and offering criticism in a way that is helpful and encouraging, not demeaning.
4.  **Acknowledging Rights:** Understanding that others have the same fundamental rights as you do.

#### g. Living Peacefully

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "An evolved society is a peaceful society where wars and conflicts are minimal or non-existent. Peaceful living enhances quality of life." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "To live peacefully, one should start [by installing] peace within (self). Charity begins at home." (Naagarazan Textbook)
*   "The essence of oriental philosophy is that one should not *fight* for peace... War or peace can be won only by peace, and not by wars!" (Naagarazan Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Living peacefully is a state of harmony that begins with the individual and extends outward to family, the workplace, and society. It is not merely the absence of conflict, but the active practice of virtues that promote understanding and cooperation.

*   **Principles for Peaceful Living:**
    *   **Internal Peace:** Cultivating order, pure thoughts, and creativity within oneself.
    *   **Respect and Appreciation:** Respecting others and appreciating differences instead of seeing them as a source of conflict.
    *   **Forgiveness:** Letting go of grievances and giving others the benefit of the doubt.
    *   **Non-Interference:** Not meddling in others' affairs unless it is absolutely necessary or you are asked.
    *   **Service:** Helping the needy, which fosters a sense of connection and reduces social friction.

#### h. Caring and Sharing

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   **Caring:** "Caring is having and expressing concern about others and their feelings and well-being... It includes showing respect to the feelings of others, and also respecting and preserving the interests of all others concerned." (Naagarazan Textbook & Life Skills Textbook)
*   **Sharing:** "Sharing of knowledge, facilities, goods, experience etc. leads to collective growth of society... Sharing tends to maximize the overall happiness of human beings." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   **Distinction:** "Primarily, caring influences ‘sharing’." (Naagarazan Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Caring and sharing are two distinct but deeply connected virtues.

*   **Caring** is the **internal feeling** or attitude of concern for the well-being of others. It is the emotional and psychological foundation. It's about empathy, compassion, and a genuine desire to see others thrive.
    *   *Example:* Feeling concerned for a colleague who is struggling with a heavy workload.

*   **Sharing** is the **external action** that often results from a caring attitude. It is the voluntary and genuine act of giving something you have—whether it's knowledge, time, resources, or experience—to benefit others, without expecting anything in return.
    *   *Example:* A senior engineer taking the time to mentor a junior engineer (sharing knowledge), or a company contributing to a local school (sharing resources).

> **`Exam Tip:`** A 2-mark question "Distinguish between 'caring' and 'sharing'" is very likely. The best way to answer is: **Caring is the internal attitude of concern for others, while sharing is the external action of giving to others. Caring is the 'why' (the motivation), and sharing is the 'what' (the act).**
