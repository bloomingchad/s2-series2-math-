#### i. Courage

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Contrary to popular conception, courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is the ability to face the fear and do something in spite of being afraid." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Courage is the tendency to accept and face risks and difficult tasks in rational ways. Self-confidence is the basic requirement to nurture courage." (Naagarazan Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Courage is the virtue that allows you to act on your other values, especially when it is difficult or risky. It is about doing the right thing even when you are afraid of the consequences.

*   **Types of Courage:**
    1.  **Physical Courage:** Facing physical danger or pain (e.g., a firefighter entering a burning building).
    2.  **Social Courage (Moral Courage):** Standing up for one's beliefs against social pressure, injustice, or discrimination, even at the risk of being unpopular (e.g., Gandhiji protesting against British rule).
    3.  **Intellectual Courage:** The courage to challenge prevailing beliefs and speak the truth, even if it upsets the status quo (e.g., Copernicus defying the church's view of the solar system).

*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** An engineer discovers a safety flaw in a product that is about to be launched. His manager tells him to ignore it to avoid a costly delay. The engineer feels afraid of losing his job, but he shows **moral courage** by reporting the flaw to senior management anyway, because he values public safety above his personal security.

#### j. Commitment

##### **Key Definitions from Source material:**
*   "The quality of holding on to a cause that one believes in, in spite of difficulties and setbacks with fervent attitude and sustained interest is called commitment." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Commitment means alignment to goals and adherence to ethical principles during the activities." (Naagarazan Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Commitment is the driving force that keeps you going. It is the deep-seated dedication to a goal, a value, or a profession that enables you to persevere through challenges. In a professional context, it means being fully invested in your work and in upholding ethical standards.

*   **Organizational Commitment:** An employee's psychological attachment to their organization. The three components are:
    1.  **Affective Commitment (Want to stay):** Emotional attachment and belief in the organization's values. You stay because you love the job.
    2.  **Continuance Commitment (Need to stay):** Based on the fear of loss if you leave (e.g., losing salary, benefits, or career progression). You stay because you can't afford to leave.
    3.  **Normative Commitment (Ought to stay):** A sense of obligation or duty to the organization. You stay because you feel it's the right thing to do.

> **`Exam Tip:`** A question on commitment is a great opportunity to show depth. Explaining the three components (Affective, Continuance, Normative) demonstrates a thorough understanding. For example: "A committed engineer not only aligns with goals (general commitment) but might also feel an emotional bond to the company's mission (affective), a sense of duty to their team (normative), and a need to see the project through (continuance)."

#### k. Empathy

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Empathy is the ability and willingness to imagine oneself in another's place and see things through their perspective. It's about 'putting oneself in the other person's shoes'." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Empathy is social radar. Sensing what others feel about, without their open talk, is the essence of empathy." (Naagarazan Textbook)

##### **Explanation:**
Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. It's different from sympathy, which is feeling *for* someone. Empathy is feeling *with* someone. It involves listening, understanding perspectives, and showing genuine concern.

*   **Why Empathy is Crucial in a Professional Setting:**
    *   **Better Teamwork:** Understanding your colleagues' motivations and pressures leads to better collaboration.
    *   **Customer Needs:** Empathizing with customers allows you to understand their problems and design better solutions for them.
    *   **Leadership:** An empathetic leader can better motivate their team because they understand what drives each individual.

*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** A project manager notices a team member is missing deadlines and seems distracted. Instead of just criticizing their performance, the manager has a private conversation and learns the employee is dealing with a family health crisis. By showing **empathy**, the manager can adjust workloads and offer support, which not only helps the employee but also builds long-term loyalty and trust.

#### l. Self-confidence

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Self confidence is the quality of believing in oneself and one's abilities." (Life Skills Textbook)
*   "Certainty in one’s own capabilities, values, and goals, is self-confidence." (Naagarazan Textbook)
*   It encompasses two separate traits: **Self-esteem** and **Self-efficacy**.

##### **Explanation:**
Self-confidence is the trust you have in your own judgment and abilities. It's a foundational virtue that allows you to take on challenges, accept feedback, and act with courage.

*   **The Two Components:**
    1.  **Self-Esteem:** Your innate sense of self-worth. It's the belief that you are valuable and deserving of happiness and respect, regardless of your accomplishments. It’s your value *as a person*.
    2.  **Self-Efficacy:** Your belief in your *ability to perform a specific task* or achieve a goal. It's confidence in your skills and competence.

*   **Distinction:** You can have high self-esteem (you feel good about who you are) but low self-efficacy in a specific area (e.g., "I am a good person, but I am not confident in my public speaking skills"). A healthy self-confidence involves a balance of both.

*   **Importance in the Workplace:**
    *   Confident employees are more willing to share ideas, take on challenges, and admit mistakes.
    *   They are more resilient in the face of setbacks.
    *   They inspire confidence in others, including colleagues and clients.
