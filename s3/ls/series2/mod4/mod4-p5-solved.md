### Module 4: Solved Question Bank

Here are the detailed answers to the questions above.

#### **Part A: Solved Questions**

**1. Distinguish between 'caring' and 'sharing'.**

**Answer:**
Caring is the internal attitude of concern for the well-being and feelings of others, while sharing is the external action of voluntarily giving resources, knowledge, or time to others. Caring is the emotional motivation, whereas sharing is the physical or intellectual act that stems from that motivation. In essence, caring is the 'why' (the feeling), and sharing is the 'what' (the action).

**2. Explain the term 'moral dilemma'.**

**Answer:**
A moral dilemma is a situation where an individual faces a conflict between two or more moral duties, rights, or values, and fulfilling one would mean violating another. There is no clear "right" or "wrong" choice, and any available option has a negative ethical consequence. For example, an engineer has a duty of confidentiality to their employer but also a duty to protect public safety. A moral dilemma arises if they discover a product flaw that could harm the public, forcing them to choose between these conflicting duties.

**3. Explain the importance of sharing and caring for a professional.**

**Answer:**
Sharing and caring are vital for a professional as they build the foundation of trust, collaboration, and a positive work environment.
*   **Caring** fosters empathy and respect among colleagues, leading to better teamwork and higher morale.
*   **Sharing** knowledge and expertise promotes collective growth, enhances problem-solving, and contributes to the development of junior professionals.
Together, they create a culture where individuals support each other, which increases overall organizational effectiveness and upholds the service-oriented ideals of a profession.

**4. Describe about civic virtue and how it is related to respect for others.**

**Answer:**
**Civic virtue** refers to the moral duties and responsible habits of a citizen that contribute to the well-being of the community (e.g., paying taxes, keeping public spaces clean, voting). It is directly related to **respect for others** because these virtuous actions are motivated by a fundamental respect for the rights, safety, and shared environment of fellow citizens. One acts as a good citizen not just out of legal obligation, but out of a moral concern for the welfare of others in the community.

---

**5. Examine the relevance of self-confidence and factors that shape it.**

**Answer:**
**Relevance:** Self-confidence is highly relevant for a professional because it is the belief in one's own abilities and judgment. It enables professionals to take on challenges, make rational decisions under pressure, act with courage when facing ethical dilemmas, and accept constructive criticism for growth.
**Factors that shape it:**
1.  **Heredity and Family Environment:** Attitudes of parents and elders.
2.  **Friendship:** Influence of supportive peers and colleagues.
3.  **Role Models/Superiors:** Guidance and encouragement from mentors.
4.  **Training and Experience:** Gaining competence and skills builds a strong sense of self-efficacy.

**6. Distinguish between morality and ethics.**

**Answer:**

| Feature | Morality | Ethics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source** | Individual conscience, personal beliefs. | External system (profession, society). |
| **Nature** | Internal, subjective. | External, objective, and codified. |
| **Governs** | The private individual. | The public/professional individual. |
| **Example** | "I personally believe lying is always wrong." | "The engineering code of ethics requires truthful public statements." |

#### **Part B: Solved Questions**

**7. Explain the positive and negative features of code of ethics.**

**Answer:** (This is a simplified version of the more detailed Q10)
A code of ethics provides a framework for professional conduct.

**Positive Features (Advantages):**
*   **Inspiration and Guidance:** Provides a clear statement of the profession's commitment to the public good and guides members on how to act in ethically ambiguous situations.
*   **Support for Professionals:** Gives engineers a justification for standing up to unethical demands from employers or clients.
*   **Deterrence and Discipline:** Establishes a standard for judging misconduct and can be used to discipline members who violate the code.
*   **Education and Public Image:** Educates professionals about their obligations and creates a positive public image of the profession as trustworthy and responsible.

**Negative Features (Limitations):**
*   **Vagueness:** Codes often contain general or vague language (e.g., "act honorably") which can be difficult to apply to specific situations.
*   **Internal Conflicts:** Different clauses within a code can conflict (e.g., a duty of confidentiality vs. a duty to protect the public).
*   **Limited Reach:** Codes are only enforceable for members of the professional society and have no legal authority over non-members.
*   **Cannot Replace Judgment:** A code is not a substitute for sound moral reasoning; it is a guide, and professionals must still use their judgment to interpret and apply it.

**8. Outline the influence of cooperation and commitment on ethical practices and their effectiveness in promoting ethical behavior.**

**Answer:**
Cooperation and commitment are two essential virtues that directly influence and strengthen ethical practices within a profession. They are crucial for moving ethical principles from theory into effective action.

*   **Influence of Cooperation:**
    *   **Definition:** Cooperation is the team spirit and willingness to work together towards common goals.
    *   **Influence on Ethical Practice:** In complex engineering projects, cooperation ensures that information is shared openly, potential risks are identified collectively, and solutions are reviewed by multiple perspectives. This collaborative process acts as a check against individual errors or unethical shortcuts. A cooperative environment promotes **collegiality** and reduces the "silo effect" where one department's actions might unknowingly create an ethical hazard for another.
    *   **Effectiveness:** It promotes effective ethical behavior by creating transparency and shared accountability. When a team cooperates, it is harder for unethical actions to go unnoticed.

*   **Influence of Commitment:**
    *   **Definition:** Commitment is the sustained dedication to one's goals and adherence to ethical principles, even in the face of difficulties.
    *   **Influence on Ethical Practice:** Commitment is the internal drive that ensures a professional adheres to ethical standards, not just when it is easy, but especially when it is difficult. When faced with pressure to cut corners, falsify data, or overlook a safety risk, a committed engineer will stand firm on their ethical obligations. This virtue provides the resilience needed to uphold professional integrity.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Commitment makes ethical behavior robust and reliable. An uncommitted person might follow ethical rules when convenient, but a committed professional will follow them consistently, thus promoting a culture of unwavering ethical conduct.

**In summary**, cooperation creates the collaborative *environment* for ethical behavior to thrive, while commitment provides the individual *fortitude* to ensure that behavior is consistent and unwavering.

**9. Explain the role of integrity in work ethics with the help of suitable example. (4 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Role of Integrity:** Integrity is the cornerstone of work ethics. Work ethics are the set of moral principles that guide behavior in the workplace, and integrity ensures these principles are applied consistently and honestly. Integrity means having a "unity of thought, word, and deed," which means a person of integrity not only knows the right thing to do (work ethics) but also does it, even when no one is watching. It transforms work ethics from a list of rules into a personal character trait.

**Suitable Example:**
A company's work ethics policy states that all product test data must be reported accurately. An engineer, Alex, runs a test on a new product and finds a minor failure that will cause a project delay.
*   **Without Integrity:** Alex might be tempted to alter the data slightly to show a "pass," thinking it's a small issue and will avoid trouble with management. Here, he is violating the work ethic.
*   **With Integrity:** Because Alex has integrity, his actions align with his professional duty. He reports the failure accurately, as required by the company's work ethics. He does the right thing despite the negative short-term consequences (project delay), thereby upholding both his personal integrity and the organization's work ethics, and protecting the public in the long run.

**10. Exemplify the significance of 'Codes of Ethics' in a professional engineer's career. Also state the advantages and limitations of the code of ethics.**

**Answer:**
**Significance of 'Codes of Ethics':**
Codes of Ethics are profoundly significant in a professional engineer's career as they serve as a moral compass, guiding their decisions and actions. They define the engineer's obligations to the public, clients, employers, and the profession itself.

*   **Example of Significance:** An engineer, Sarah, is working on a bridge project. The client pressures her to use a cheaper, substandard grade of steel to cut costs. Sarah feels a conflict between her loyalty to the client and her professional duty. She refers to the NSPE Code of Ethics, which states engineers must **"hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public."** This code gives her the clear justification and moral support to refuse the client's request. It empowers her to explain that using the cheaper steel would violate her professional ethical duty, thereby protecting her career from future liability and, more importantly, protecting the public from a potential disaster.

**Advantages of a Code of Ethics:**
*   **Guidance and Clarity:** Provides a framework for navigating complex ethical situations.
*   **Professional Support:** Offers a formal basis to refuse unethical demands.
*   **Public Trust:** Assures the public that the profession is committed to high standards, enhancing its reputation.
*   **Deterrence:** Discourages unethical behavior by setting clear standards and threatening disciplinary action.

**Limitations of a Code of Ethics:**
*   **Vagueness:** The principles are often broad and may not provide clear answers for every specific dilemma.
*   **Internal Conflicts:** Clauses within the code can conflict with each other (e.g., confidentiality vs. public safety).
*   **Enforcement Issues:** The power to discipline is often limited to members of the professional organization and may lack legal force.
*   **Not a Substitute for Judgment:** A code cannot replace an individual's critical thinking and moral reasoning. It is a guide, not an algorithm for every ethical problem.
