### 3. Problem Solving in Groups

#### a. Groupthink

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Group thinking is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision making." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   "Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus by actively suppressing dissenting viewpoints and by isolating themselves from outside influences, without critical evaluation of alternative viewpoints." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   "Group thinking requires individuals to avoid raising controversial issues or alternative solutions, and there is loss of individual creativity, uniqueness and independent thinking." (HUN 101 Slides)

##### **Explanation:**
Groupthink is the **#1 enemy of effective group problem-solving**. It's what happens when a group values harmony and agreement so much that it stops thinking critically. The pressure to conform becomes so strong that members are afraid to voice different opinions, leading to bad decisions.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Illusion of Invulnerability:** The group feels it can do no wrong.
    *   **Pressure on Dissenters:** Anyone who disagrees is pressured to conform.
    *   **Self-Censorship:** Members don't speak up because they fear being the "odd one out."
    *   **Illusion of Unanimity:** Silence is mistaken for agreement.
*   **Why it's dangerous:** It leads to a failure to consider alternatives, a lack of contingency planning, and ultimately, poor or even disastrous outcomes.
*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** Imagine a project team deciding on a topic. The first idea suggested is "okay," but not great. However, because the group leader seems to like it and no one wants to "rock the boat" or start an argument, everyone just nods in agreement. They don't explore other, potentially better ideas. Later, they realize the topic is too difficult and their project suffers. This is a classic case of **Groupthink**. To avoid it, the leader should have actively encouraged debate and asked, "What are some other options we could consider?"

#### b. Consensus

##### **Key Definitions from Source Material:**
*   "Consensus is a general agreement or a collective opinion." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   "Achieving group consensus helps effective decision making." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   "The team members discuss the subject until each member agrees to the decision." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   "Everyone will come to the positive side of agreeing even though different opinions will be there." (HUN 101 Slides)

##### **Explanation:**
Consensus is the ideal way for a team to make a decision. It's different from a simple majority vote. Consensus means that even if the final decision isn't a person's first choice, they understand the reasoning behind it, have had a chance to voice their opinion, and are willing to **support the decision** as if it were their own. It's about finding a solution that everyone can "live with" and commit to.

*   **Consensus vs. Unanimity:** Unanimity means everyone agrees 100%. Consensus means everyone *supports* the decision for the good of the team.
*   **Why it's powerful:** It builds commitment. When people feel heard and are part of the decision-making process, they are much more likely to work hard to implement the decision successfully. It leverages the collective wisdom of the entire group.
*   **Apply-Level Scenario:** After a long debate about two possible design approaches (Storming), a team decides to go with Approach A. One engineer still privately believes Approach B was slightly better. However, because her concerns were listened to and addressed, and she understands the team's reasons for choosing A, she says, "Okay, I can support this decision. Let's make Approach A work." This is **Consensus**. The team moves forward united, not divided.

#### c. Group Problem Solving Techniques

These are structured methods to facilitate brainstorming and decision-making, designed to avoid Groupthink and help a group reach a well-considered consensus.

##### **i. Brainstorming**

*   **Key Definition:** "Process for generating creative ideas and solutions through intensive and freewheeling group discussion. Every participant is encouraged to think aloud and suggest as many ideas as possible... Analysis, discussion, or criticism of the aired ideas is allowed only when the brainstorming session is over." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   **Explanation:** The golden rule of brainstorming is **quantity over quality** and **no criticism**. The goal is to generate as many ideas as possible, no matter how "crazy" they seem. By deferring judgment, you create a psychologically safe space where creativity can flourish. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can then move to an evaluation phase.

##### **ii. Multi-voting**

*   **Key Definition:** "Multi voting is a fast method to select the most relevant and popular ideas from a list with the least difficulty and least chances of conflict." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   **Explanation:** This is a simple way to narrow down a long list of brainstormed ideas.
    1.  **List:** All ideas are listed and numbered.
    2.  **Vote:** Each member gets a certain number of votes (e.g., 3-5 votes) and can cast them for the ideas they think are best. They can put all their votes on one idea or spread them out.
    3.  **Tally:** The votes are counted.
    4.  **Prioritize:** The ideas with the most votes are selected for further discussion. It's a quick, democratic way to see which ideas have the most group support.

##### **iii. Nominal Group Technique (NGT)**

*   **Key Definition:** "Each member thinks independently about the problem and silently writes his ideas on a paper. Moderator asks for ideas and writes those on a board... Each recorded idea will be evaluated. Each member votes for 5 ideas he thinks the best." (HUN 101 Slides)
*   **Explanation:** NGT is a more structured version of brainstorming designed to prevent a few loud voices from dominating the discussion. The "nominal" part means the group is a group "in name only" during the idea generation phase.
    1.  **Silent Generation:** Everyone silently writes down their ideas on paper. This ensures introverts and junior members contribute equally.
    2.  **Round Robin:** The facilitator goes around the room, and each person shares one idea from their list, which is written on a whiteboard for all to see. This continues until all ideas are shared, with no criticism or discussion allowed.
    3.  **Clarification:** The group discusses the ideas on the board to make sure everyone understands them.
    4.  **Voting:** Members privately vote or rank their preferred ideas. The results are tallied to produce the group's final decision.
*   **Advantage:** It ensures equal participation and separates idea generation from evaluation.
