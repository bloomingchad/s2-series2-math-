### Detailed Notes

#### 1. MATLAB Environment

[Click here to see an image of the MATLAB Environment](https://www.google.com/search?q=matlab+environment+window&tbm=isch)

*   **Command Window:** The main window where you type commands one by one. The `>>` is the command prompt. Commands are executed immediately after you press Enter.
*   **Workspace:** This window lists all the variables you have created in the current session (e.g., `a = 10`). It shows the variable name, its value, and its data type (e.g., `double`). This is useful for tracking your data.
*   **Command History:** Records all the commands you have typed in the Command Window, allowing you to easily reuse or re-run them.
*   **Current Directory:** Shows the files and folders in the current working folder. Your MATLAB scripts (.m files) must be in this directory or in the MATLAB search path to run them.
*   **Edit Window (Editor):** A text editor used to write, edit, and save programs, which are called **m-files** or script files. These files have a `.m` extension. This is where you write longer programs that you want to save and run multiple times.

#### 2. MATLAB Fundamentals

*   **Variables:** You create variables by assigning a value to a name, e.g., `a = 10;`. The semicolon `;` at the end of a line suppresses the output, meaning MATLAB will perform the calculation but not display the result in the Command Window.
*   **Arithmetic Operators:** `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `^` (power).
*   **Vectors:** A 1D array of numbers.
    *   **Row Vector:** `rowVec = [1, 2, 3];` or `rowVec = [1 2 3];`
    *   **Column Vector:** `colVec = [4; 5; 6];`
    *   **Vector with a step:** `v = 1:2:10;` creates a vector `[1 3 5 7 9]`. The format is `start:step:end`.
*   **Matrices:** A 2D array of numbers. Semicolons separate rows.
    *   `A = [1 2; 3 4];` creates the matrix A =  
        $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$$

#### 3. Programming in MATLAB

##### a. M-Files (Script Files)
An m-file is a simple text file containing a sequence of MATLAB commands. When you run the file, MATLAB executes the commands in order. This is how you create and save programs.

##### b. Control Structures
*   **`if-else` Statement:** Used for decision-making.
    ```matlab
    if condition
        % code to execute if condition is true
    elseif another_condition
        % code to execute if another_condition is true
    else
        % code to execute if no conditions are true
    end
    ```
*   **`for` Loop:** Repeats a block of code a fixed number of times.
    ```matlab
    for index = start_value:end_value
        % code to repeat
    end
    ```
*   **`while` Loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    ```matlab
    while condition
        % code to repeat
        % make sure to update the condition variable
    end
    ```

##### c. Functions
A function is a special type of m-file that can accept inputs and return outputs. The first line must be `function [output1, output2] = functionName(input1, input2)`. The file must be saved with the same name as the function (e.g., `functionName.m`).

#### 4. Plotting and Visualization

*   **`plot(x, y)`:** The primary command for creating 2D line plots. `x` is the vector of x-coordinates and `y` is the vector of y-coordinates. `x` and `y` must have the same length.
*   **`figure;`:** Opens a new figure window, so your next plot doesn't overwrite the previous one.
*   **`xlabel('text')`, `ylabel('text')`, `title('text')`:** Commands to label the x-axis, y-axis, and add a title to the plot.
*   **`legend('data1', 'data2')`:** Adds a legend to distinguish multiple lines on the same graph.
*   **`hold on;` and `hold off;`:** `hold on` tells MATLAB to add the next plot to the current graph instead of replacing it. `hold off` returns to the default behavior.

### Solved Question Bank (Module 2)

**Q1: Write MATLAB/SCILAB commands to plot y = sin(x) for x = 0 to 2π. Label axes and add title.**
**Answer:**
```matlab
x = 0:0.01:2*pi;  % Create an x-vector from 0 to 2*pi with small steps
y = sin(x);         % Calculate the sine of each element in x
plot(x, y);         % Plot y versus x
xlabel('x (radians)'); % Label the x-axis
ylabel('sin(x)');     % Label the y-axis
title('Plot of sin(x) from 0 to 2*pi'); % Add a title
grid on;            % Add a grid for better readability
```

**Q2: Plot y1 = sin(x) and y2 = cos(x) on the same graph with legends.**
**Answer:**
```matlab
x = 0:0.01:2*pi;  % Create the x-vector
y1 = sin(x);        % Calculate sin(x)
y2 = cos(x);        % Calculate cos(x)
plot(x, y1, 'r-', x, y2, 'b--'); % Plot y1 as a solid red line and y2 as a dashed blue line
xlabel('x');
ylabel('Function Value');
title('Plot of sin(x) and cos(x)');
legend('y1 = sin(x)', 'y2 = cos(x)'); % Add legends
grid on;
```
*Alternatively, using `hold on`:*
```matlab
x = 0:0.01:2*pi;
y1 = sin(x);
y2 = cos(x);
plot(x, y1, 'r-'); % Plot the first graph
hold on;          % Hold the current graph
plot(x, y2, 'b--'); % Plot the second graph on top
hold off;         % Release the hold
xlabel('x'); ylabel('Function Value'); title('Plot of sin(x) and cos(x)');
legend('sin(x)', 'cos(x)');
grid on;
```

**Q3: Write a function fact(n) in MATLAB/SCILAB that returns the factorial of a number.**
**Answer:**
1.  Create a new m-file named `fact.m`.
2.  Write the following code in the file:

```matlab
function output = fact(n)
    % This function calculates the factorial of a number n.
    if n < 0
        error('Input must be a non-negative integer.');
    elseif n == 0
        output = 1;
    else
        output = 1;
        for i = 1:n
            output = output * i;
        end
    end
end
```
*To use it, save the file and then type `y = fact(5)` in the Command Window.*

**Q4: Write a MATLAB/SCILAB program using if-else to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.**
**Answer:**
```matlab
num = input('Enter a number: '); % Prompt user to enter a number

if num > 0
    disp('The number is positive.');
elseif num < 0
    disp('The number is negative.');
else
    disp('The number is zero.');
end
```

**Q5: Write MATLAB/SCILAB code to compute the sum of first n natural numbers using a for loop.**
**Answer:**
```matlab
n = input('Enter a positive integer n: '); % Get n from the user
total_sum = 0; % Initialize sum to 0

for i = 1:n
    total_sum = total_sum + i;
end

fprintf('The sum of the first %d natural numbers is %d.\n', n, total_sum);
```
*(Note: A more efficient MATLAB way is simply `total_sum = sum(1:n);` but this question specifically asks for a `for` loop.)*

**Q6: Write a MATLAB/SCILAB command to:**
**(a) Clear all variables, (b) Display current directory, (c) Generate a vector from 1 to 10 with step size 2, (d) Create a 3x3 matrix A and find its transpose, determinant, and inverse.**

**Answer:**
**(a) Clear all variables:**
`clear all;`

**(b) Display current directory:**
`pwd` (print working directory)

**(c) Generate a vector from 1 to 10 with step size 2:**
`v = 1:2:10;`

**(d) Create a 3x3 matrix A and find its transpose, determinant, and inverse:**
```matlab
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 0]; % Create a 3x3 matrix

A_transpose = A';          % Find the transpose
A_determinant = det(A);    % Find the determinant
A_inverse = inv(A);        % Find the inverse

disp('Original Matrix A:'); disp(A);
disp('Transpose of A:'); disp(A_transpose);
disp('Determinant of A:'); disp(A_determinant);
disp('Inverse of A:'); disp(A_inverse);
```

**Q7: Write a MATLAB/SCILAB program to check if a given number is palindrome or not.**
**Answer:**
```matlab
num_str = input('Enter a number: ', 's'); % Input number as a string
reversed_str = fliplr(num_str); % Reverse the string

if strcmp(num_str, reversed_str)
    fprintf('%s is a palindrome.\n', num_str);
else
    fprintf('%s is not a palindrome.\n', num_str);
end
```
*Example: For `12521`, the program will output that it is a palindrome.*

**Q8: Write a MATLAB/SCILAB program to check if a given number is Armstrong or not.**
**(e.g., 153 is an Armstrong number because 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153)**
**Answer:**
```matlab
num_str = input('Enter a number to check for Armstrong: ', 's');
n = length(num_str); % Number of digits
num = str2double(num_str); % Convert string to number
sum_of_powers = 0;

for i = 1:n
    digit = str2double(num_str(i));
    sum_of_powers = sum_of_powers + digit^n;
end

if sum_of_powers == num
    fprintf('%d is an Armstrong number.\n', num);
else
    fprintf('%d is not an Armstrong number.\n', num);
end
```
