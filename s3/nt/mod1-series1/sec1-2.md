## **1.2 Essentials of Indicating Instruments**

For any indicating instrument to operate correctly and provide an accurate, stable reading, it must possess three essential torques (or forces). These torques work together to move the pointer, stop it at the correct value, and ensure the reading is stable and quick.

The three essential torques are:
1.  **Deflecting Torque (T<sub>d</sub>)**
2.  **Controlling Torque (T<sub>c</sub>)**
3.  **Damping Torque**

### **1. Deflecting Torque (T<sub>d</sub>)**

Also known as the **Operating Torque**, this is the force that causes the moving system (and the pointer attached to it) to move from its zero position.

*   **Function:** To produce a deflection that is proportional to the quantity being measured.
*   **Source:** It is generated by the electrical quantity (voltage, current, power) that the instrument is designed to measure. The method of production depends on the type of instrument (e.g., magnetic, heating, or electrostatic effect of current/voltage).
*   **Example (PMMC Instrument):** In a Permanent Magnet Moving Coil (PMMC) instrument, the deflecting torque is produced by the force exerted on a current-carrying coil placed in a permanent magnetic field.
    *   [Click here to see a diagram of a PMMC Instrument](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=PMMC+instrument+working+diagram)
    *   The formula is: **T<sub>d</sub> = N ⋅ B ⋅ I ⋅ A**
    *   Where:
        *   **N** = Number of turns in the coil
        *   **B** = Magnetic flux density in the air gap (in Weber/m² or Tesla)
        *   **I** = Current flowing through the coil (in Amperes)
        *   **A** = Effective area of the coil (length × width) (in m²)

### **2. Controlling Torque (T<sub>c</sub>)**

Also known as the **Restoring Torque**, this force opposes the deflecting torque.

*   **Functions:**
    1.  It increases as the pointer's deflection increases, opposing the deflecting torque at every point.
    2.  It brings the pointer to a stop at a position where the controlling torque becomes equal to the deflecting torque (**T<sub>c</sub> = T<sub>d</sub>**). This equilibrium position gives the measured value.
    3.  It brings the pointer back to the zero position when the electrical quantity is removed (i.e., when T<sub>d</sub> becomes zero).

Without a controlling torque, the pointer would swing to its maximum position for any non-zero measurement. There are two primary methods for producing this torque:

#### **Methods of Producing Controlling Torque**

| Feature | Spring Control | Gravity Control |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | One or two hairsprings are attached to the moving system. As the pointer deflects, the springs twist, producing a restoring torque. <br>[Click for figure](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=spring+control+mechanism+in+measuring+instruments) | A small adjustable weight is attached to an arm on the moving system. Deflection causes this weight to be lifted, and gravity creates a restoring torque. <br>[Click for figure](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=gravity+control+mechanism+in+measuring+instruments) |
| **Torque Equation**| **T<sub>c</sub> ∝ θ** <br> (Torque is directly proportional to the angle of deflection, θ) <br> **T<sub>c</sub> = K<sub>s</sub> ⋅ θ** <br> (K<sub>s</sub> is the spring constant) | **T<sub>c</sub> ∝ sin(θ)** <br> (Torque is proportional to the sine of the deflection angle, θ) <br> **T<sub>c</sub> = K<sub>g</sub> ⋅ sin(θ)** <br> (K<sub>g</sub> is a constant related to the weight and its distance from the pivot) |
| **Scale** | The scale is **uniform** because the deflection (θ) is directly proportional to the current (I). | The scale is **non-uniform** and cramped at the lower end because the current (I) is proportional to sin(θ), not θ. |
| **Application** | Most common method. Used in almost all **portable instruments** (e.g., multimeters). | Used in panel-mounted, stationary instruments (e.g., some lab voltmeters). The instrument **must be kept vertical**. |
| **Material (Spring)** | **Phosphor Bronze** is used. **Why?** It has low specific resistance, is non-magnetic, is not subject to fatigue, and is not greatly affected by temperature changes. | An adjustable control weight. |

**At Equilibrium (Final Reading):**
The pointer comes to rest when:
**Deflecting Torque = Controlling Torque**
**T<sub>d</sub> = T<sub>c</sub>**

### **3. Damping Torque**

This is a braking torque that acts on the moving system **only when it is in motion**.

*   **Function:** To prevent the pointer from oscillating around its final steady-state position and to allow it to settle down **quickly**. An instrument where the pointer comes to rest rapidly without overshoot is called **"dead-beat"**.
*   **Necessity:** Due to the inertia of the moving system, when a deflecting torque is applied, the pointer tends to overshoot its final position. The controlling torque then brings it back, causing it to overshoot in the opposite direction. This oscillation would continue for some time before it settles. Damping torque prevents this.

#### **Conditions of Damping**
[Click here for a graph showing different damping conditions](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=underdamped+overdamped+critically+damped+graph)
1.  **Underdamped:** The pointer oscillates around the final position before coming to rest.
2.  **Overdamped:** The pointer is sluggish and moves very slowly to its final position without any oscillation.
3.  **Critically Damped:** The ideal condition where the pointer moves to its final position in the shortest possible time without any overshoot or oscillation.

#### **Methods of Damping**

**a) Air Friction Damping**
*   **Mechanism:** A light aluminum piston moves inside an air chamber with a small clearance. As the pointer moves, the piston compresses or rarefies the air in the chamber, creating a force that opposes the motion.
*   [Click here to see a diagram of Air Friction Damping](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=air+friction+damping+diagram)
*   **Use:** Simple and cheap. Used in instruments where the operating magnetic field is weak (e.g., Moving Iron instruments).

**b) Fluid Friction Damping**
*   **Mechanism:** Similar to air friction, but a vane is dipped in a pot of high-viscosity damping oil. The viscous drag on the vane opposes the motion.
*   [Click here to see a diagram of Fluid Friction Damping](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=fluid+friction+damping+diagram)
*   **Use:** More effective than air friction due to higher viscosity. Used in some high-voltage instruments. Has drawbacks like oil leakage and dust collection.

**c) Eddy Current Damping**
*   **This is the most efficient and effective method of damping.**
*   **Mechanism:** A non-magnetic conducting disc (usually aluminum) is attached to the moving system and is placed so that it moves through the field of a permanent magnet. As the disc moves, it cuts magnetic flux lines, which induces **eddy currents** in it. According to **Lenz's Law**, these currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the motion that caused them. This opposition provides a very effective braking (damping) torque.
*   [Click here to see a diagram of Eddy Current Damping](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=eddy+current+damping+diagram)
*   **Use:** Used in instruments that have a strong permanent magnet as part of their operating system, making it ideal for **PMMC instruments**.

### **Relevant Questions from Question Bank**

**Q3. Differentiate between deflecting torque and controlling torque.**
*   **Deflecting Torque (T<sub>d</sub>):** The driving torque that moves the pointer away from zero. It is proportional to the quantity being measured.
*   **Controlling Torque (T<sub>c</sub>):** The restoring torque that opposes the deflecting torque and brings the pointer back to zero when the measurement is removed. The pointer stops when T<sub>d</sub> = T<sub>c</sub>.

**Q4. Which is the most efficient damping method. Explain its working principle.**
*   **Eddy current damping** is the most efficient method.
*   **Working Principle:** It works on the principle of Lenz's Law. A conducting non-magnetic former or disc moves in a magnetic field. This motion induces eddy currents within the conductor. These eddy currents produce a magnetic field that interacts with the original field to create a force that opposes the motion, thus damping the system quickly and effectively.

**Q5 & Q6. Explain gravity control and spring control in measuring instruments using a neat diagram and mathematical expression. Which is the most commonly used material to manufacture these springs and why?**
*   *The explanation and expressions for both are detailed in the table above.*
*   **Material:** The most commonly used material for springs is **Phosphor Bronze**.
*   **Reason:** It has desirable properties like being **non-magnetic** (so it doesn't interfere with the instrument's magnetic fields), having **low specific resistance** (so it can also be used to lead current to the coil), and being resistant to **mechanical fatigue**, ensuring the controlling torque remains consistent over time.
