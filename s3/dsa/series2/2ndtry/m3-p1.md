Of course! Based on your audio recording, the provided slides, and question papers, here are the study notes for the first half of Module 3.

As you requested, I've focused on the core concepts, algorithms (pseudocode), and application-style examples your teacher mentioned. I've also included Google Image links to help you visualize the concepts quickly.

# Module 3: Trees and Graphs

### Priority Topics from Audio:
*   **Binary Tree & Traversals:** The three types of traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order) are extremely important. You need to know their algorithms and how to apply them.
*   **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Definition, how to construct a BST from given values, and algorithms for insertion and deletion.

## Part 1: Introduction to Trees

A tree is a **non-linear** data structure that organizes data in a hierarchical format. It consists of nodes connected by edges.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   There is one special node called the **Root**, which is the starting point of the tree.
    *   Every other node is connected from the root via a unique path.
    *   A tree with 'n' nodes will always have 'n-1' edges.

### Basic Tree Terminology

Understanding these terms is crucial before moving to Binary Trees.

| Term | Description | Visual Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Node** | An entity that contains a value or data. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+node) |
| **Edge** | The connecting link between two nodes. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+edge) |
| **Root** | The topmost node in a tree. It's the only node with no parent. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+root+node) |
| **Parent** | A node that has a branch extending to another node. (e.g., A is the parent of B). | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+parent+child) |
| **Child** | A node that is a descendant of another node. (e.g., B is a child of A). | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+parent+child) |
| **Siblings** | Nodes that share the same parent. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+siblings) |
| **Leaf Node** | A node that has no children. Also called an external node. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+leaf+node) |
| **Internal Node**| A node that has at least one child. All non-leaf nodes are internal nodes. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+internal+node) |
| **Height** | The number of edges on the longest path from a node down to a leaf node. The height of the tree is the height of the root node. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=height+of+a+tree+data+structure) |
| **Depth** | The number of edges from the root to a specific node. The depth of the root is 0. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=depth+of+a+node+in+tree) |
| **Subtree** | A tree whose root is a child of a node in a larger tree. | [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tree+data+structure+subtree) |

## Part 2: Binary Trees

A **Binary Tree** is a special type of tree where each node can have at most **two** children: a left child and a right child.

### Binary Tree Traversal (Very Important!)

Traversal is the process of visiting (or checking) each node in a tree exactly once. Your teacher emphasized that questions on this are very common and can be asked in different ways.

There are three main types of **Depth-First Traversal**:

1.  **Pre-order Traversal (NLR: Node -> Left -> Right)**
2.  **In-order Traversal (LNR: Left -> Node -> Right)**
3.  **Post-order Traversal (LRN: Left -> Right -> Node)**

#### 1. Pre-order Traversal (NLR)

**Rule:** Visit the **Node**, then traverse the **Left** subtree, then traverse the **Right** subtree.

*   [Visual Example of Pre-order Traversal](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=pre-order+traversal+example)

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**
```
PREORDER(TREE)
  Step 1: Repeat Steps 2 to 4 while TREE != NULL
  Step 2: Visit TREE -> DATA (e.g., print it)
  Step 3: PREORDER(TREE -> LEFT)
  Step 4: PREORDER(TREE -> RIGHT)
  [END OF LOOP]
Step 5: END
```

**Example Application:**
Given the following tree:


*   **Start at A (Node):** Visit **A**.
*   **Go Left to B (Node):** Visit **B**.
*   **Go Left to D (Node):** Visit **D**. (D has no children, so return)
*   **Go Right from B to E (Node):** Visit **E**. (E has no children, so return)
*   (Finished B's subtree, return to A)
*   **Go Right from A to C (Node):** Visit **C**.
*   **Go Left to F (Node):** Visit **F**. (F has no children, so return)
*   **Go Right from C to G (Node):** Visit **G**. (G has no children, so return)
*   (Finished C's subtree, return to A)
*   Done.

**Pre-order Traversal Output:** `A, B, D, E, C, F, G`

#### 2. In-order Traversal (LNR)

**Rule:** Traverse the **Left** subtree, then visit the **Node**, then traverse the **Right** subtree.
> **Tip:** For a Binary *Search* Tree, an in-order traversal always results in the nodes being visited in sorted (ascending) order.

*   [Visual Example of In-order Traversal](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=in-order+traversal+example)

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**
```
INORDER(TREE)
  Step 1: Repeat Steps 2 to 4 while TREE != NULL
  Step 2: INORDER(TREE -> LEFT)
  Step 3: Visit TREE -> DATA (e.g., print it)
  Step 4: INORDER(TREE -> RIGHT)
  [END OF LOOP]
Step 5: END
```

**Example Application (Same Tree):**


*   Start at A. Go **Left** to B.
*   At B, go **Left** to D.
*   At D, Left is null. Visit **D (Node)**. Right is null. Return to B.
*   At B, Left is done. Visit **B (Node)**.
*   At B, go **Right** to E.
*   At E, Left is null. Visit **E (Node)**. Right is null. Return to B.
*   B's subtree is done. Return to A.
*   At A, Left is done. Visit **A (Node)**.
*   At A, go **Right** to C.
*   (Repeat the process for C's subtree: Left -> Node -> Right)
*   Visit **F**, then **C**, then **G**.

**In-order Traversal Output:** `D, B, E, A, F, C, G`

#### 3. Post-order Traversal (LRN)

**Rule:** Traverse the **Left** subtree, then traverse the **Right** subtree, then visit the **Node**.

*   [Visual Example of Post-order Traversal](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=post-order+traversal+example)

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**
```
POSTORDER(TREE)
  Step 1: Repeat Steps 2 to 4 while TREE != NULL
  Step 2: POSTORDER(TREE -> LEFT)
  Step 3: POSTORDER(TREE -> RIGHT)
  Step 4: Visit TREE -> DATA (e.g., print it)
  [END OF LOOP]
Step 5: END
```

**Example Application (Same Tree):**


*   Start at A. Go **Left** to B. Go **Left** to D.
*   At D, Left is null, Right is null. Visit **D**. Return to B.
*   At B, go **Right** to E.
*   At E, Left is null, Right is null. Visit **E**. Return to B.
*   At B, Left and Right are done. Visit **B**. Return to A.
*   (B's subtree is fully traversed).
*   At A, go **Right** to C.
*   (Repeat for C's subtree: visit F, then G, then C).
*   At A, Left and Right are done. Visit **A**.

**Post-order Traversal Output:** `D, E, B, F, G, C, A`
