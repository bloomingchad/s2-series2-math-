# S3 Maths Lab: A Practical Guide with Python

Welcome to the S3 Maths Lab repository! This collection of notes serves as a practical, code-first guide to the core mathematical concepts covered in the curriculum, including Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Complex Analysis. The examples are implemented using popular Python libraries like `SymPy`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`, providing a hands-on approach to understanding the theory.

This guide is designed for students and enthusiasts who want to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and practical computation. By running the code, you can experiment with functions, visualize vectors, and verify theorems, solidifying your understanding along the way.

## Learning Environment Setup

To run the code in these notes, a scientific Python environment is required. The recommended setup is **Anaconda**, which bundles Python with all the necessary libraries and tools.

1.  **Install Anaconda:** Download and install the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your operating system.
2.  **Launch Jupyter:** Use the **Anaconda Navigator** (a graphical application) to launch **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.
3.  **Run the Code:** Copy the code blocks from these notes into the cells of a new Jupyter notebook and execute them by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

## Structure of the Notes

The notes are organized into several markdown files, each focusing on a major mathematical topic. This modular structure allows for focused learning.

### Table of Contents

*   **[1. Python Foundations for Scientific Computing](./PYTHON_FOUNDATIONS.md)**
    *   An introduction to the essential tools: `SymPy` for symbolic math, `NumPy` for numerical arrays, and `Matplotlib` for plotting. This is the starting point for anyone new to these libraries.

    *   Covers fundamental calculus operations, including:
        *   Differentiation and evaluating derivatives.
        *   Partial Differentiation.
        *   Indefinite and Definite Integration.
        *   Double Integration.

*   **[3. Linear Algebra - Core Concepts](./LINEAR_ALGEBRA_CORE.md)**
    *   Focuses on the building blocks of linear algebra:
        *   Creating Vectors and Matrices with `SymPy` and `NumPy`.
        *   Vector Operations: Dot Product, Cross Product, and Norm (Length).
        *   Matrix Properties: Rank and Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF).

*   **[4. Linear Algebra - Vector Spaces](./LINEAR_ALGEBRA_VECTOR_SPACES.md)**
    *   Explores the abstract concepts of vector spaces:
        *   Checking for Linear Independence of vectors, matrices, and polynomials.
        *   Finding the Basis and Dimension of Row and Column Spaces.
        *   Determining if a set of vectors forms a basis for a space.
        *   Visualizing vectors and their span.

*   **[5. Complex Analysis](./COMPLEX_ANALYSIS.md)**
    *   Introduces the application of Python to complex numbers and functions:
        *   Finding the Real and Imaginary Parts of complex functions.
        *   Verifying the Cauchy-Riemann Equations to check for analyticity.
        *   Computational verification of Cauchy's Integral Theorem and Formula.
