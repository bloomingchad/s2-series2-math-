### Detailed Notes

#### 1. Introduction to Simulink

##### a. What is Simulink?
*   **Key Definition:** Simulink is a **graphical programming environment** for modeling, simulating, and analyzing multi-domain dynamic systems. It is an extension of MATLAB, meaning it is fully integrated and can share data seamlessly with the main MATLAB environment.
*   **How it Works:** Instead of writing code line-by-line, you build a model by dragging and dropping blocks from a library and connecting them with lines that represent signals. The block diagram visually represents the mathematical relationships between the system's components.

##### b. Importance & Key Features
*   **Importance:** Simulink is essential for modern engineering because it allows for **Model-Based Design**. You can design, simulate, and test a system (like a control system for a robot or an electrical power converter) entirely in a virtual environment before building any hardware.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Visual & Intuitive:** Block diagrams are easier to understand and debug than complex code for many engineers.
    *   **Extensive Libraries:** Contains thousands of pre-built blocks for everything from simple math operations to complex components like motors and filters.
    *   **Multi-Domain:** Can simulate electrical, mechanical, thermal, and control systems all in one model.
    *   **Integration with MATLAB:** You can use MATLAB scripts to automate simulations, analyze data from Simulink, and customize blocks.

#### 2. The Simulink Environment

*   **Starting Simulink:** You can start Simulink by typing `simulink` in the MATLAB Command Window or by clicking the Simulink icon.
*   **Simulink Library Browser:** This is the heart of Simulink. It's a window that organizes all the available blocks into libraries.
    [Click here to see an image of the Simulink Library Browser](https://www.google.com/search?q=simulink+library+browser&tbm=isch)
*   **Key Block Categories:**
    *   **Sources:** Generate signals to drive the simulation (e.g., Sine Wave, Step, Constant, Signal Generator).
    *   **Sinks:** Display or save simulation results (e.g., **Scope** for plotting signals, **Display** for showing numerical values, **To Workspace** for saving data to MATLAB).
    *   **Continuous:** Blocks for continuous-time systems (e.g., **Integrator**, **Derivative**, **Transfer Fcn**).
    *   **Math Operations:** Blocks for mathematical functions (e.g., **Sum**, **Product**, **Gain**).
*   **The Model Window:** This is the blank canvas where you drag blocks from the library and connect them to build your system model.

#### 3. The Core Modeling Process

This is the most critical concept in the module.
**Goal:** Convert a real-world problem into a Simulink simulation.

##### **Step 1: Derive the Mathematical Model**
Before you can simulate anything, you need to describe it with mathematics. For electrical circuits, this usually involves applying Kirchhoff's laws (KVL, KCL) to get a set of differential equations.
*   *Example (RC Circuit):* Using KVL, you get  $V_{in}(t) = R \cdot i(t) + V_c(t)$. Since $i(t) = C \frac{dV_c}{dt}$, the final equation is $V_{in}(t) = RC \frac{dV_c}{dt} + V_c(t)$.

##### **Step 2: Convert Math to Simulink Blocks**
Rearrange the equation to isolate the highest-order derivative.
From our example:  $\frac{dV_c}{dt} = \frac{1}{RC} (V_{in}(t) - V_c(t))$
Now, translate each mathematical operation into a block:
*   **Subtraction (`-`):** Use a **Sum** block (configured for `+-`).
*   **Multiplication by a constant (`1/RC`):** Use a **Gain** block.
*   **Integration (`âˆ« dt`):** This is the key. To get $V_c$ from $\frac{dV_c}{dt}$, you use an **Integrator** block.

##### **Step 3: Build, Configure, and Run**
1.  **Build:** Drag the necessary blocks (Step for $V_{in}$, Sum, Gain, Integrator, Scope) into the model window.
2.  **Connect:** Connect them with signal lines to represent the equation. The output of the Integrator ($V_c$) is fed back into the Sum block.
3.  **Configure:** Double-click each block to set its parameters (e.g., set the value in the Gain block to `1/(R*C)`).
4.  **Run:** Set the simulation stop time and press the "Run" button. The **Scope** block will then display the output waveform (the charging capacitor voltage).

### Solved Question Bank (Module 3)

**Q1: Define Simulink.**
**Answer:** Simulink is a graphical extension to MATLAB for the modeling, simulation, and analysis of dynamic systems. It allows users to build systems as block diagrams by dragging and dropping blocks from a library and connecting them with signals, providing a visual and intuitive alternative to text-based programming.

**Q2: Illustrate the major steps involved in the following simulation cases using MATLAB/SIMULINK:**
**(i) DC transient analysis of a RLC Series circuit**
**(ii) AC steady state analysis of a parallel RLC circuit**

**Answer:**
**(i) DC Transient Analysis of a Series RLC Circuit:**
This simulation analyzes how the circuit currents and voltages change over time after a DC voltage is suddenly applied (e.g., by closing a switch).
**Major Steps:**
1.  **Mathematical Model:** The governing equation from KVL is $V_{in} = Ri(t) + L\frac{di(t)}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}\int i(t)dt$. This is a second-order differential equation.
2.  **Simulink Implementation:**
    *   **Input Source:** Use a **Step** block to simulate the sudden application of a DC voltage at t=0.
    *   **Circuit Elements:** Use blocks from the **Simscape > Electrical** library (e.g., Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor, DC Voltage Source). This is often easier than building the differential equation manually.
    *   **Measurement:** Use **Current Measurement** and **Voltage Measurement** blocks to measure the desired signals.
    *   **Output Sink:** Connect the measurement blocks to a **Scope** to visualize the transient response (e.g., the damped oscillations of the current).
3.  **Configuration & Simulation:** Set the values for R, L, C, and the input voltage. Set the simulation stop time to be long enough to observe the full transient response, then run the simulation.

**(ii) AC Steady State Analysis of a Parallel RLC Circuit:**
This simulation analyzes how the circuit behaves under a sinusoidal AC source after all transients have died down, focusing on magnitudes and phase angles.
**Major Steps:**
1.  **Mathematical Model:** Analysis is done in the frequency domain using phasors and impedances. The total impedance Z is given by $\frac{1}{Z} = \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{j\omega L} + j\omega C$.
2.  **Simulink Implementation:**
    *   **Input Source:** Use an **AC Voltage Source** block from the Simscape library.
    *   **Circuit Elements:** Use **Series RLC Branch** blocks and configure them as separate R, L, and C elements connected in parallel.
    *   **Measurement:** Use **Current Measurement** blocks in each branch to measure $I_R$, $I_L$, and $I_C$, and a **Voltage Measurement** block to measure the source voltage.
    *   **Output Sink:** Use a **Scope** to view the waveforms. To see steady-state behavior, you may need to run the simulation for a few cycles. For analyzing magnitude and phase, an **RMS** block or a **Fourier** block can be used.
3.  **Configuration & Simulation:** Set the R, L, C values and the amplitude and frequency of the AC source. Run the simulation and observe the phase relationships between the currents in the Scope.

**Q3 (from chat): Write the MATLAB/SCILAB code to plot X1 Vs Y1, X2 Vs Y2 & X3 Vs Y3 such that all the three plots are visualized row wise in a single figure.**
**Answer:** This requires the `subplot` command. The format is `subplot(rows, columns, plot_number)`. To arrange 3 plots row-wise, you need a 1x3 grid.
```matlab
% --- Sample Data (replace with your actual data) ---
x1 = 0:0.1:10; y1 = sin(x1);
x2 = 0:0.1:10; y2 = cos(x2);
x3 = 0:0.1:10; y3 = tan(x3);

% --- Create a single figure for all plots ---
figure;

% --- Plot 1: Top plot ---
subplot(3, 1, 1); % Create a 3x1 grid, activate the 1st plot
plot(x1, y1);
title('Plot 1: X1 vs Y1');
xlabel('X1');
ylabel('Y1');
grid on;

% --- Plot 2: Middle plot ---
subplot(3, 1, 2); % Activate the 2nd plot in the 3x1 grid
plot(x2, y2);
title('Plot 2: X2 vs Y2');
xlabel('X2');
ylabel('Y2');
grid on;

% --- Plot 3: Bottom plot ---
subplot(3, 1, 3); % Activate the 3rd plot in the 3x1 grid
plot(x3, y3);
title('Plot 3: X3 vs Y3');
xlabel('X3');
ylabel('Y3');
grid on;
```
*(Correction from original prompt: "row wise" usually implies one on top of the other, hence a 3x1 grid. If it meant side-by-side, you would use `subplot(1, 3, plot_number)`).*
